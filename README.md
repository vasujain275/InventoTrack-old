# InventoTrack: Smart Inventory Management System

## Project Overview

For a company that deals with a wide range of products, and managing inventory efficiently is crucial. The goal of this project is to create a robust backend system that optimizes inventory management, automates processes, and ensures accurate stock tracking.

## Technical Requirements

### Technology Stack

- **Backend Language**: JavaScript (Node.js)
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for secure API endpoints.
- **Testing**: Jest or Mocha for unit and integration testing.

### User Authentication and Authorization

- Develop a user authentication system with roles (admin, manager, staff).
- Admins can manage users, while staff can only access inventory-related features.

### Inventory Management Features

- **Product CRUD Operations**:
  - Create, read, update, and delete product records.
  - Include fields like name, description, price, quantity, and category.
- **Stock Tracking**:
  - Automatically update stock levels upon purchase or sale.
  - Implement FIFO (First-In-First-Out) logic for perishable goods.
- **Alerts and Notifications**:
  - Notify staff when stock levels are low or when a product is out of stock.
  - Send alerts for expiring products.
- **Reporting and Analytics**:
  - Generate reports on sales, stock levels, and product performance.
  - Visualize data using charts or graphs.

### API Design and Documentation

- Create well-structured RESTful APIs.
- Document endpoints using tools like Swagger or Postman.

### Security and Validation

- Sanitize input data to prevent SQL injection and other security vulnerabilities.
- Implement rate limiting and protect against brute-force attacks.

### Error Handling and Logging

- Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.
- Log critical events for debugging and auditing purposes.

### Deployment and Scalability

- Deploy the backend on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
- Optimize for scalability by using load balancers and caching.

## Project Milestones

3. **Stock Tracking and Alerts (Week 3)**

   - Update stock levels based on transactions.
   - Set up alerts for low stock and expiring products.

4. **Reporting and Analytics (Week 4)**

   - Generate basic reports.
   - Visualize data using a charting library (e.g., Chart.js).

5. **Testing and Documentation (Week 5)**

   - Write unit and integration tests.
   - Document API endpoints.

6. **Deployment and Optimization (Week 6)**
   - Deploy the backend to a production environment.
   - Optimize for performance and scalability.

## Conclusion
